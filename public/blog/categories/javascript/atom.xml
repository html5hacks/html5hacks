<p><img class="imgR300" alt="ok200 Conference" src="http://html5hacks.com/images/200ok/200ok1.jpg"></p>

<p>I spend my days writing a lot of JavaScript, and helping companies deliver ambitious UX focused applications to the web. I <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do?cmp=af-code-book-product_cj_9781449334994_7080585">author books</a> on the subject, blog, and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/jdcravens/">speak at conferences</a> as often as I can.</p>

<p>I work for <a href="http://frogdesign.com">frog</a>, a product design firm, that for the last forty years has been helping increase the profiles of brands like Sony and Apple through iconic design.</p>

<p>I work within a culture that has deep roots into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">the Maker Movement</a>; A culture that was making before the Maker Movement was cool, the &ldquo;original makers&rdquo; if you will. Written upon our walls and slide decks is the tag, <a href="https://vimeo.com/24940735">&lsquo;Love What You Make&rsquo;</a>, and as you might expect many of the frogs that sit around me are craftsfolk, DIYourselfers, and tinkerers. It is not uncommon to see a flying quadcopter, a mesh sensor network of Arduinos, 3D printed prototypes, explorations in next generation gesture with the Leap Motion and Kinect, video production, motion studies, 3D modeling, along with the standard artistic mood boards and web and native mobile application wireframes. Let&rsquo;s just say there is no shortage of creativity across every medium imaginable.</p>

<h2>Sharing My Craft with my Children</h2>

<p><img class="imgL300" alt="ok200 Conference - setting up" src="http://html5hacks.com/images/200ok/200ok2.jpg"></p>

<p>All of that being said, I&rsquo;m a parent of two young children. My little ones constantly challenge me to find ways to share quality time with them. The parents reading this know the juggling act.</p>

<p>What I try to do is architect bridges between my children&rsquo;s curiosity and the passions of others that have explored their crafts in a deep way. Myself, and my wife, being the most important of those craftsfolk.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m doing it right, when I spend time with my children, they should share in my excitement and passion. If I&rsquo;m doing it wrong, I&rsquo;m overwhelmed and exhausted from work. In my vision, my children should be witnessing a model of how to wake up everyday with the goal of embracing opportunity to create a combination of function and beauty within the world around them.</p>

<p><img class="imgR200" alt="Maker Faire" src="http://html5hacks.com/images/200ok/Maker_Faire.gif"></p>

<p>So it is in this context, that I met up with Mozilla&rsquo;s Luke Crouch, and <a href="http://makerfairetulsa.com/">Tulsa Mini Maker Faire</a>&rsquo;s Scott Phillips to put together <a href="http://200ok.us/schedule/javascript-makers/">the closing keynote at the 200ok conference</a> .</p>

<h2>JavaScript Makers: How JS is Helping Drive the Maker Movement</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://200ok.us/schedule/javascript-makers/">200ok conference</a> is on track to become Oklaoma&rsquo;s premier web conference attracting a sold out crowd of web professionals from all over Oklahoma and the neighboring states. Going in, I felt as though I knew my audience well. In other words, if I spoke to them about languages they would understand, JavaScript and HTML5, my message would easily resonate. I also knew that given their location, Tulsa, OK, a presentation that touched upon work life balance and family values would immediate strike a chord as well.</p>

<p>So in the spirit of authenticity, I pretended as if getting prepared for a closing keynote dependent on hacked together hardware and software demos wasn&rsquo;t challenging enough; I made the decision to include my 6 year old son, Carter with a flying drone and a custom configured Minecraft server accessible over conference wifi. I knew this would ensure that the presentation dangled on the brink of disaster, mirroring the chaotic reality of both open hacking and parenting.</p>

<p>My thinking was that a presentation on this topic should be authentic, and reflect the reality of my proposition, not be an ivory tower, academic/authoritative talk about how to share your craft with your children. I also made sure to not prep Carter. With a loose structure in place, we took the stage and worked our way through a story that consisted of 12 open software and hardware demos that showcased JavaScript as a primary scripting language, and a table full of hardware that ranged from a drone, a dissected wifli helicopter and erector set, a leap motion, and numerous prototyping boards.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="10" data-id="78b4c9300a8801313e8202078d31cabc" data-ratio="1.2994923857868" src="http://html5hacks.com//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<p>Here are some of the highlights:</p>

<h2>JavaScript and Prototyping Boards</h2>

<p>Earlier this year I did a presentation at HTML5.tx that focused on building an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00_BGRkBRM">Internet of Things with JavaScript</a> and various open hardware prototyping boards such as Arduino, BeagleBone, and the Raspberry Pi. It was in that talk that I made a connection that eventually led to an introduction to Luke. So, given that the HTML5.tx content was of interest I started the presentation with a demo of the Arduino, <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Johnny Five</a>, the original Beaglebone and <a href="https://github.com/jadonk/bonescript">BoneScript</a>.</p>

<h2>Nodecopter and the Leap Motion</h2>

<p>One crowd favorite was mapping the gestures from the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> to the <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">Parrot AR drone</a>, so that a one finger clockwise gesture triggered a nodecopter takeoff. A counter clockwise gesture then landed it. I was able to put this together using the leapJS and node-ardrone node modules, based on some initial hacking by <a href="https://twitter.com/markuskobler">Markus Kobler</a>, where he pulled this off at a <a href="https://github.com/markuskobler/nodecopter-london">Nodecopter London event</a>.</p>

<h2>ScriptCraft: Running JavaScript from within Minecraft</h2>

<p><img class="imgL300" alt="ok200 Conference" src="http://html5hacks.com/images/200ok/200ok3.jpg"></p>

<p>Later, I showed how to script inside of the Minecraft virtual world, using <a href="https://twitter.com/walter">Walter Higgins'</a> great <a href="https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft">ScriptCraft library</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the conference wifi, and single access point, to suffice in allowing Carter and I to interact within virtual world. I was also concerned about the dynamic IP, and having to change it on the fly, start/restart the server, etc. So I made the decision 10 minutes before to not have Carter log in, and I would just speak to the possibility instead. In true 6 year old fashion, he rebelled and logged onto my server, popping up in front of me wearing a Creeper mask, as I was mid stream explaining how to script wooden signs with his 1st grade sight words as a homework exercise. Needless to say, his innapropriate behavior was a crowd favorite. I have to admit, it was mine as well.</p>

<p><img class="imgR300" alt="ok200 Conference" src="http://html5hacks.com/images/200ok/200ok4.png"></p>

<p>Going into the talk, I knew I&rsquo;d either be trying this again in the future or abandoning it as &lsquo;one of those ideas&rsquo; that sounded good in theory, but was just not going to work. Where did I land? Well, let&rsquo;s just say that Carter and I are looking for our next opportunity to share our experiences with other parents/web professionals.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript is executed in a single thread. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with threads, what this means is that JavaScript can only execute one block of code at a time. If code is already executing, any interaction by the user will instantiate an asynchronous event that is queued up for later execution. Other events like those from XMLHttpRequests and timers, are also added to the queue.</p>

<p>So, as you might expect, a single-threaded architecture can be problematic to the user experience if a particular script takes a long time to complete.</p>

<p>For SXSWi and FluentConf this year, <a href="http://twitter.com/boyofgreen">@boyofgreen</a> and I created a demo application to showcase some of the hacks that we included in our book OReilly&rsquo;s HTML5 Hacks.</p>

<p>The demo application, Nerdclustr, is an HTML5 mobile application that brings &lsquo;nerds&rsquo; of all types together conferences and provides a visual map that updates in real time. The application was written with Node.js and the Express web framework. It demonstrates the following specifications: HTML5 Web Forms, Geo Location API, WebSocket, Canvas, CSS3 transforms.</p>

<p>Given, the attention that Web Components and <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/polymer.html">Polymer.js</a> have been getting lately, I felt this was a good opportunity to demonstrate some of the exciting new specifications that are making their way to modern browsers. For the sake of this tutorial, I&rsquo;ll be using and providing screenshots of Google Chrome, but it should be worth your time to explore the status of each of the specifications in other modern browsers as well.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will take a look at the HTML5 specs mentioned above in detail. Then, we will explore Polymer.js and build out an example application.</p>

    <link href="http://html5hacks.com/blog/2013/06/17/add-narration-to-your-slide-deck-with-html5-audio/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-17T10:11:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://html5hacks.com/blog/2013/06/17/add-narration-to-your-slide-deck-with-html5-audio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Most presenter will share their slide deck on the web after their presentation. But many times the slides are only a shell of the real talk. Fortunately, with HTML5 audio, we can add our voice back to our slides and recreate the real presentation.</strong></p>

<h2>Sample Example</h2>

<p>To show what we&rsquo;re trying to accomplish, I&rsquo;ve created <a href="http://kevinlamping.com/deck.narrator.js/sample/sample.html">a very basic slide deck with audio narration</a> which briefly describes the issue at hand.</p>

<h2>Audio on the Web</h2>

<p>Back when the web was just taking off, it was common (bad) practice to include audio on your page. I&rsquo;m not talking about a Flash-based music player, but rather the more primitive audio solution: <code>&lt;bgsound&gt;</code>. Those who were programming back when HTML 3.2 came out will be familiar with this oft-forgotten tag.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, <code>&lt;bgsound&gt;</code> isn&rsquo;t the end of the story. According to <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/bgsound">the latest W3C spec</a>, <code>&lt;bgsound&gt;</code> has a much friendlier HTML5 alternative that you&rsquo;ve likely heard of: the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>So what benefits does <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> bring us? Well, <code>&lt;bgsound&gt;</code> was an IE only property. <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> on the other hand has wide support, with only IE 7 &amp; 8 lacking functionality. <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> also allows API access so that we can control playback, seek through the audio, and even manipulate the data with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebRTC/MediaStream_API">MediaStream API</a>. Plus, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag allows you to use native controls and/or provide your own customized controls.</p>

<h2>File formats</h2>

<p>Before getting in to the details on how we&rsquo;re going to use the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag, we need to talk a little about file formats. The MP3 format has gained tremendous popularity over the last decade and a half, but unfortunately due to licensing requirements, relying on MP3&rsquo;s for our audio is a messy situation.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag supports multiple formats gracefully. This means we can create a patchwork of audio file formats to gain full browser support. And we&rsquo;ll need a patch work because no one format is currently supported across all browsers.</p>

<p>For our needs, we&rsquo;ve created two files: an MP4/AAC file and an OggVorbis file.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to read more on the subject, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.scirra.com/blog/44/on-html5-audio-formats-aac-and-ogg">Ashley Gullen&rsquo;s post &lsquo;On HTML5 audio formats &ndash; AAC and Ogg&rsquo;</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Use It?</h2>

<p>We can load our audio files by adding in two <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> tags with information about our two audio files inside of the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>index.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio</span> <span class="na">controls</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;myPlayer&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;source</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;myAudio.m4a&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;audio/mp4&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;source</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;myAudio.ogg&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;audio/ogg&quot;</span>  <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  Your browser does not support HTML5 audio.
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>There are two attributes for each <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> tag. The &lsquo;src&rsquo; attribute, whose value is the path to the audio file, and the &lsquo;type&rsquo; attribute, whose value is the MIME type of the file.</p>

<p>Again, the browser will choose whichever file it supports without you having to do any detective work. Very nice.</p>

<h2>Starting/Stopping</h2>

<p>Okay, so now if we load this into a webpage we&rsquo;ll get a simple audio player that we can manually control. What&rsquo;s nice is that since we used the &lsquo;controls&rsquo; attribute, the audio player controls are built for us by the browser. This makes allowing manual control of our audio very simple.</p>

<p>For our needs, we want to control the playback of the audio programmatically. To do this, let&rsquo;s take a look at the API for starting and stopping playback. The element has two built-in methods for this, &lsquo;play&rsquo; and &lsquo;pause&rsquo;. Calling those methods is straightforward:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>audio.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">audioPlayer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nx">myPlayer</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">audioPlayer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">play</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">audioPlayer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pause</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>These methods will come in handy in a moment when we want to start playing our audio after we change slides.</p>

<h2>Seeking</h2>

<p>The other part of the equation is the ability to seek to different locations in our audio. Again, this is very simple. Our element has a &lsquo;currentTime&rsquo; property that can be both get and set (in seconds).</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>audio.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">audioPlayer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">currentTime</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// returns 0 since we haven&amp;rsquo;t started playing the audio yet</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">audioPlayer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">play</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">audioPlayer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">currentTime</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// returns 11</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">},</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>As you can see, getting and setting the current time is a trivial process. In the Part 2, we&rsquo;ll put this functionality to use by adding narration to slides.</p>

<h2>Implementing Slide Narration</h2>

<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got the building blocks for implementing a slide narrator. To make things easier, we&rsquo;re going to use the fantastic <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">&lsquo;Deck.js&rsquo; project</a> as our HTML slide framework. Deck.js supports extensions, which allows you to add functionality to your slides beyond what&rsquo;s already provided.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be creating a new extension called Narrator. For brevity&rsquo;s sake, I won&rsquo;t get into the details of Deck.js or creating extensions, but you can check out the code in <a href="https://github.com/klamping/deck.narrator.js">the deck.narrator.js GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>Our extension boils down to one requirement: It should automatically play a defined section of audio on each slide.</p>

<p>That might sound simple, but we need to figure out a couple of things first:</p>

<ul>
<li>How will we define what audio to play for each slide?</li>
<li>How will we stop the audio after it gets to the end of the section</li>
</ul>


<h2>Defining Audio Stops</h2>

<p>There are a couple of ways to define what segment of the audio each slide plays. You could define a start time and a stop time for each slide, but that seems like too much work. Instead we&rsquo;ll just define how long each slide should play for, and then calculate the implied start and stop timestamps for each slide.</p>

<p>To store our audio duration, we&rsquo;ll take advantage of <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/">HTML5 data-* attributes</a> by creating a custom &lsquo;data-narrator-duration&rsquo; attribute. The value of this will be the number of seconds to play the audio for. Here&rsquo;s a sample slide element for a Deck.js HTML file.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>index.html </span></figcaption>

<p>Then, upon page initialization, we&rsquo;ll loop through each slide element and calculate the proper start/stop timestamps for each slide. This is important in case our viewer wants to move through the slides in a non-linear fashion. Here&rsquo;s the basic code:</p>

<h2>Adding Playback Automatically on Slide Change</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got our segment timestamps defined, let&rsquo;s look at playing that audio on each slide transition. Deck.js fires a &lsquo;deck.change&rsquo; event when the slide is changed, so we can hook into that and have it call our changeSlides function, which looks like this:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>deck.narrator.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Most of the code makes sense, but I do want to talk about the &lsquo;segmentEnd&rsquo; line and what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>

<h2>Playing Segments of Audio</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t give the <code>play()</code> function an amount of time to play for. Once you start playing, it will keep going until it runs out of audio or you tell it to pause. Thankfully, the audio element emits a &lsquo;timeupdate&rsquo; event which we can listen to in order to pause playback once our segment timestamp has been reached. We can add that listener just like any other event listener:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>deck.narrator.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">audio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nx">timeupdate</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;,</span> <span class="nx">checkTime</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Our &lsquo;checkTime&rsquo; function is very small. All it does is check to see if currentTime in the audio is greater than the segmentEnd time. If so, it pauses our audio:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>deck.narrator.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">checkTime</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">audio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">currentTime</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="nx">segmentEnd</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">audio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pause</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h2>Automatically Moving Through Slides</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got our audio hooked up to our slides, we can take advantage of the other extensions already written for Deck.js. <a href="deck.automatic.js">https://github.com/rchampourlier/deck.automatic.js/‎</a> is an extension that makes your slides run automatically. By including this extension with our presentation, we can recreate that &lsquo;presentation&rsquo; feel to our slides.</p>

<p>Aside from the going through the steps of adding the automatic extension, we also need to make sure that if a user starts/stops the audio, we start/stop the slideshow playback. To do this, we&rsquo;ll sync up <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Media_events">the &lsquo;play&rsquo; and &lsquo;pause&rsquo; events of our audio element</a> with the automatic extension. For simplicity, we&rsquo;re going to control all slide playback using our audio controls and leave off the deck.automatic.js playback control.</p>

<p>Deck.automatic.js adds some events to the mix, including &lsquo;play&rsquo; and &lsquo;pause&rsquo; events. By triggering these events when our similarly named audio events fire, we can make sure our slides are in sync with our content.</p>

<p>We add two simple functions to our extension:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>deck.narrator.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">startSlides</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ev</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">deck</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nx">play</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">stopSlides</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ev</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">deck</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nx">pause</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And then add our event listeners in the deck.init callback:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>deck.narrator.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nx">deck</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">init</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">rsquo</span><span class="p">;,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="c1">// &amp;hellip; other code here &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Also, since our slides automatically advance, we need to comment out the &lsquo;timeupdate&rsquo; event listener which would pause our audio at the end of a slide.</p>

<p>With those things taken care of, our slides and audio automatically transition to create a seamless experience.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>One thing the code doesn&rsquo;t take into consideration is if the user navigation the audio themselves. We could add this by listening to the &lsquo;seeked&rsquo; event from the audio element and calculating where in the slide deck we should move to.</p>

<p>There is also some duplication around defining the duration of the as a result of adding in the automatic slide advancement extension. The other extension is looking for a data-duration attribute on each slide. This can be easily fixed by updating our code to look for that attribute instead.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to add in some captioning for folks who either cannot hear the audio or are in a public place and simply forgot their headphones. There is <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/track">a new <code>track</code> tag</a> that can handle this for us, so that&rsquo;s a likely route we can go down.</p>

<h2>Summing Up</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s the majority of the code. I left out a few details in relation to some deck.js configurations, so again check out <a href="https://github.com/klamping/deck.narrator.js">the GitHub repo for the full example</a>.</p>

<p>This is an exploration of Handlebars.js template library when used with Ember.js views. Many of the Handlebars.js tutorials on the web discuss the Handlebars API, but not in the specific context of using Handlebars with Ember.js. In addition to filling that void, I&rsquo;ll also give a brief background of JavaScript templating in general to provide perspective as to the problems it is solving.</p>

<p>This tutorial will be divided into two parts. In Part 1, you should gain a clear understanding of JavaScript templates, the capabilities of Handlebars expressions and helpers, and how to write your own Handlebars helpers.</p>
