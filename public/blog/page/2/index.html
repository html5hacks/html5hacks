  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a specification that allows applications to
make requests to other domains from within the browser. With CORS you have a secure
and easy-to-implement approach for circumventing the browser’s same origin
policy.</p>

<p>In this hack we will explore hosting a web font on a cloud drive. In order to do so, we
will learn how to configure an Amazon S3 bucket to accept requests from other domains.</p>

<p>If you are not already familiar with web fonts and @font-face, refer to Hack #12.</p>

<p>In the next section I provide a bit more background on Amazon S3 and the same origin
policy, before we get into the details of CORS.</p>

<h3>What Is an Amazon S3 Bucket?</h3>

<p>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is simply a cloud drive. Files of all kinds can be
stored using this service, but web application developers often use it to store static
assets such as images, JavaScript files, and stylesheets.</p>

<p>For performance improvements, web developers like to employ Content Delivery Networks
(CDNs) to serve their static files. While Amazon S3 is not a CDN in and of itself,
it’s easy to activate it as one by using CloudFront.</p>

<p>A bucket refers to the directory name that you choose to store your static files.
To get started let’s set up an account at Amazon and navigate to the Amazon Management
Console; see Figure 9-21.</p>

<p>Figure 9-21. S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-21" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-21.png"></p>

<p>If we click on Create a Bucket we should see the prompt shown in Figure 9-22.</p>

<p>Figure 9-22. Creating an S3 bucket in the S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-22" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-22.png"></p>

<p>Let’s name the bucket and choose a region (see Figure 9-23). As I stated earlier, you
can choose a region to optimize for latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory
requirements.</p>

<p>Figure 9-23. Naming an S3 bucket in the S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-23" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-23.png"></p>

<p>We will go ahead and name our bucket none other than “html5hacks.” You should now
see an admin screen that shows an empty filesystem (see Figure 9-24).</p>

<p>Figure 9-24. The html5hacks S3 bucket</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-24" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-24.png"></p>

<p>Well, that was simple. So why are we doing this? Let’s start with some simple browser
security—something called the same origin policy.</p>

<h3>Same Origin Policy</h3>

<p>As the browser becomes more and more of an application platform, application developers
have compelling reasons to write code that makes requests to other domains
in order to interact directly with the content. Wikipedia defines same origin policy as
follows:</p>

<p>In computing, the same origin policy is an important security concept for a
number of browser-side programming languages, such as JavaScript. The
policy permits scripts running on pages originating from the same site to
access each other’s methods and properties with no specific restrictions,
but prevents access to most methods and properties across pages on different
sites.1</p>

<p>1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy</p>

<p>As stated in Wikipedia’s definition, the same origin policy is a good thing; it protects
the end user from security attacks. But it does cause some challenges for web developers.</p>

<p>This is where CORS comes into the picture. CORS allows developers of remote data
and content to designate which domains (through a whitelist) can interact with their
content.</p>

<h3>Using Web Fonts in Your Application</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways to use a web font within your web pages, such as calling
the @font-face service, bundling the font within your application, hosting the web font
in your own Amazon S3 bucket (more on this later), or converting the file to Base64
and embedding the data inline in a data-uri. By the way, the last technique is similar
to the one outlined in Hack #13.</p>

<p>Each of these techniques has limitations.</p>

<ul>
<li>When calling the @font-face service you are limited to the fonts within the particular
service’s database.</li>
<li>Bundling the font within your application does not make use of HTTP caching, so
your application will continue to download the font file on every page request.
Furthermore, you cannot reuse the font within other applications.</li>
<li>Hosting the font in an Amazon S3 bucket works great, except with Firefox, which
enforces the same origin policy on all resources. So the response from the remote
server will be denied.</li>
<li>Converting the font to Base64 adds additional weight to the stylesheet, and does
not take advantage of caching.</li>
</ul>


<p>An exploration into the different types of web fonts is beyond the scope of this hack,
so I will assume that you have already selected the web font BebasNeue.otf.
You can download free and open fonts from sites such as http://www.dafont.com.</p>

<h3>Uploading Your Font to Your Amazon S3 Bucket</h3>

<p>Now, all we have to do is to upload the font onto our filesystem in the cloud (see
Figure 9-25).</p>

<p>Figure 9-25. An uploaded BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-25" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-25.png"></p>

<h3>Adding the Web Font to Your Web Page</h3>

<p>In order to add a web font to our page, we need to add a single stylesheet to an HTML
page.</p>

<p>Here is our page. Let’s call it index.html, and add a <link> tag pointing to our base
stylesheet, styles.css.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>geo.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>S3 - font<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;styles.css&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>HTML5 Hacks<span class="err">&lt;</span>/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In our styles.css let’s add the following and point to our uploaded file. Also, let’s assign
the font to our H1 header via the test class name.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>style.css </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">BebasNeue</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">src</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://s3.amazonaws.com/html5hacks/BebasNeue.otf&#39;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.test</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;BebasNeue&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we’ll open a browser and point to our newly created HTML page. In Opera (see
Figure 9-26), Safari, and Chrome our header tag is being styled correctly.</p>

<p>Figure 9-26. Opera browser showing the BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-26" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-26.png"></p>

<p>But if we view it in Firefox, we are having issues (see Figure 9-27).</p>

<p>Figure 9-27. Firefox browser failing to show the BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-27" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-27.png"></p>

<p>If we examine the request for our font in the Chrome Dev Tools Network tab, we will
see that the response from the server is empty (see Figure 9-28).</p>

<p>Figure 9-28. Firefox browser showing an empty response</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-28" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-28.png"></p>

<p>What gives? Well, by default, Firefox will only accept links from the same domain as
the host page. If we want to include fonts from different domains, we need to add an
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the font.</p>

<p>So, if you try to serve fonts from any CDN, Firefox will not load them.</p>

<h3>What Is CORS?</h3>

<p>The CORS specification uses the XMLHttpRequest object to send and receive headers
from the originating web page to a server that is properly configured in order to
enable cross-site requests.</p>

<p>The server accepting the request must respond with the
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header with either a wildcard (*) or the correct
origin domain sent by the originating web page as the value. If the value is not included,
the request will fail.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for HTTP methods other than GET or POST, such as PUT, a preflight request
is necessary, in which the browser sends an HTTP OPTIONS request to establish
a handshake with the server before accepting the PUT request.</p>

<p>Fortunately, after enough backlash from the development community, Amazon made
CORS configuration available on Amazon S3 via a very simple XML configuration.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<h3>Configuring CORS at Amazon S3</h3>

<p>You should already be at your Amazon Management Console at http://
console.aws.amazon.com. Click on Properties→Permissions→Edit CORS configuration,
and you should receive a modal prompt.</p>

<p>The configuration can accept up to 100 rule definitions, but for our web font we will
only need a few. For this example we will use the wildcard, but if you are doing this in
production, you should whitelist the domains to prevent others from serving your font
from your S3 account on their own web pages. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, but
it might get costly.</p>

<p>The first rule allows cross-origin GET requests from any origin. The rule also allows all
headers in a preflight OPTIONS request through the
Access-Control-Request-Headers header. In response to any preflight OPTIONS
request, Amazon S3 will return any requested headers.</p>

<p>The second rule allows cross-origin GET requests from all origins. The * wildcard
character refers to all origins.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config.xml </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;CORSConfiguration&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;CORSRule&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;AllowedOrigin&gt;</span>*/AllowedOrigin&gt;
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;AllowedMethod&gt;</span>GET<span class="nt">&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/CORSRule&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/CORSConfiguration&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, let’s add our new configuration to our Editor and save (see Figure 9-29).</p>

<p>Figure 9-29. Configuring CORS in the S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-29" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-29.png"></p>

<p>Now, let’s return to Firefox and reload the page. We should now see the header font
styled with our BebasNeue web font, as shown in Figure 9-30.</p>

<p>Figure 9-30. Firefox browser successfully showing the BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-30" src="/images/chapter9-images/9-30.png"></p>

<p>There is much more to learn about CORS, most notably, HTTP POST usage with certain
MIME types, and sending cookies and HTTP authentication data with requests if so
requested by the CORS-enabled server. So get out there and starting creating your
own CORS hacks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An exploration of the future of web technologies and browser capabilities would not be complete without covering the tools and techniques available to enable location awareness.</p>

<p>Location-aware web applications provide content, functionality, and services based on the cooperative detection of the user’s physical location. These applications can then provide the user with real-time filtering of online information relevant to his current location, such as place markers indicating the user’s location within a map, local consumer reviews, local coupons and offers, and even relevant traffic and public transportation notices.</p>

<p>These applications also enable users to provide their location to friends in a social network and vice versa, creating possibilities for meetups and blended online and physical interaction.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, the opportunities are not just limited to enhancing the life of the consumer. Given real-time location data of potential consumers and their friends, retailers can also create highly targeted, location-specific marketing campaigns for both digital and physical products.</p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>The web browser employs various technologies to pass parameters via a background HTTP request to a Location Information Server that returns a data set that includes an estimated longitude and latitude.</p>

<p>The technologies used to gather location data depend on the device and on the operating system running on the device. The most common sources are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Public IP address</li>
<li>WiFi access points</li>
<li>Bluetooth MAC IDs</li>
<li>GPS</li>
<li>GSM/CDMA cell tower IDs</li>
</ul>


<p>Geolocation libraries for the Web are not new. In fact, today’s W3C Geolocation specification is largely reflective of the original Google Gears API introduced by Google in 2008. The API has been standardized and is one of the most widely adopted of the HTML5 specifications covered in this book (O&#8217;Reilly HTML5 Hacks).</p>

<p>Fortunately, the API is also easy to use—a benefit we will explore in “Use the Geolocation APIs to Display Longitude and Latitude in a Mobile Web Application” and “Update a User’s Current Location in a Google Map”.</p>

<p>In addition, a number of third-party services are available for creating really interesting hacks, and they explore concepts such as reverse geocoding and geofencing. In “Use Google’s Geocoding API to Reverse-Geocode a User’s Location” and “Use the Geoloqi Service to Build a Geofence” we will pass our location data to a service that will provide an enhanced API for working with location data.
In “Use the Geoloqi Real-Time Streaming Service to Broadcast a Remote User’s Movement” we will blend the power of the WebSocket API with location awareness to make our application update in real time.</p>

<p>For browsers that don’t provide this functionality natively, Google’s IP geocoding service can serve as a polyfill, as we will explore in “Polyfill Geolocation APIs with Webshims”.</p>

<p>The main drawback to this functionality is related to privacy and security, and for good reason. After all, as responsible application developers we should be doing what we can to protect the sensitive data of our users. In “Use the Geolocation APIs to Display Longitude and Latitude in a Mobile Web Application” we will take an in-depth look at how the browser employs cooperative detection, allowing the user to opt-in to only sharing location data with trusted web applications.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Geolocation specification exposes an easy-to-use API. With only a couple of lines of code, you can obtain the user’s current position. What’s more, jQuery Mobile provides a simple framework for building a cross-browser mobile web application.</p>

<p>In this hack we will utilize the jQuery Mobile framework to provide a relatively simple means of authoring a cross-browser mobile application. Since this hack is focused on displaying our current longitude and latitude and exercising the API across the mobile Web, we will only need a simple UI.</p>

<h3>A Simple jQuery Mobile App</h3>

<p>As you can see, we have declared a dependency on one stylesheet, and three JavaScripts. We will build the remainder of the application using declarative HTML markup and data- attributes that the jQuery Mobile framework will interpret.<br/>
Within the <body> tag, we can now place the following:</p>

<p>At this point you should see what’s shown in Figure 7-1, if you access this page from a smaller screen or shrink your desktop browser window to the size of a mobile browser.</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 7-1" src="/images/chapter7-images/7-1.png"></p>

<p>As you might expect, the UI wasn’t created through magic. jQuery Mobile uses JavaScript to consume the data- attributes present in your HTML markup to dynamically generate more HTML and CSS. The end result is what you see in your browser.
Now we will create a separate page to link to. You many have noticed a link to longlat-embed.html within the main page.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>More geo.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>This will take us to a page that will run our JavaScript that contains our geolocation code. Notice that we designated for this to not be a jQuery Mobile Ajax page. This ensures that upon the click of the link we navigate to the new page. It is important that the linked page is loaded so that its JavaScript will execute.</p>

<p>This page is structured similarly to the other page, with the same dependencies. I intentionally kept the jQuery Mobile code as simple as possible. You can find more information on working with jQuery Mobile in the excellent set of <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/">documentation</a> .</p>

<p>Now we will address our geolocation JavaScript. If you are familiar with jQuery the initial $ variable will look familiar in the code that follows. If not, you can learn more about jQuery at http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page.</p>

<p>Simply put, the jQuery function wrapper ensures that our page is ready before we execute the following script. Then we will set up a global namespace object that we will use to store our data. This type of organization will be important as our script gets more complex moving forward.</p>

<p>Next, we will check to make sure the current browser supports geolocation by checking the navigator object for the presence of the geolocation property. If it is available, we will call the getCurrentPosition method and pass a success and error object.
Then we will construct both a success and error object. Within our success object we can accept a position as a parameter and query the object for its nested coords object which contains both latitude and longitude properties.</p>

<p>We will then call populateHeader(), which uses jQuery to append the returned values to the span tags that contain the IDs Lat and Long.</p>

<p>Now let’s return to our browser and navigate to the new page. When a user accesses a web page that includes a call to navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(), a security notification bar will be presented at the top of the page. Browsers that support the Geolocation API have their own security notification, which asks the user to allow or deny the browser access to the device’s current location (see Figure 7-2).</p>

<p>Figure 7-2. Google Chrome geolocation security notification</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 7-2" src="/images/chapter7-images/7-2.png"></p>

<p>If the user allows the web application to track her physical location, the script will continue to execute and make a request to the Location Information Server. The remote server returns a data set that includes longitude and latitude. Once we have the information and the success() callback has been called, we update the page (see Figure 7-3).</p>

<h3>Security and Privacy Concerns</h3>

<p>The ability for web application developers to collect location data about end users raises quite a bit of concern in regard to security and privacy. The W3C specification clearly indicates that client applications should notify users and provide an interface to authorize the use of location data, allowing them to determine which web applications they trust:</p>

<p>User agents must not send location information to Web sites without the express permission of the user. User agents must acquire permission through a user interface, unless they have prearranged trust relationships with users, as described below. The user interface must include the host component of the document&#8217;s URI [URI]. Those permissions that are acquired through the user interface and that are preserved beyond the current browsing session (i.e. beyond the time when the browsing context [BROWSINGCONTEXT] is navigated to another URL) must be revocable and user agents must respect revoked permissions.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Single Threadin&#8217;</h2>

<p>As we set out to build a highly responsive UI for our demo web application, we must fully understand how browsers manage processes. Perhaps the biggest challenge we will face has to do with browsers using a single thread for both JavaScript execution and user interface updates. While the browser&#8217;s JavaScript interpreter is executing code, the UI is unable to respond to the user&#8217;s input. If a script is taking a long time to complete, after a specified amount of time the browser will provide the user an option to terminate the script. To accommodate for the &#8216;freeze&#8217; associated with scripts that exceed the browser execution time limit, web developers have traditionally created smaller units of work and used JavaScript timers to return execution to the next event in the queue. As you will see, web workers solve the locking of the UI thread by opening an additional thread, or even multiple threads, for execution of these long running, processor intensive tasks.</p>

<p>When designing your application, especially if you come from more of a &#8216;server-side&#8217; or Java background, it is important to understand that non-blocking execution is not the same as concurrent threading. While not extremely complex, JavaScript&#8217;s event driven style does take some getting used to for developers coming from other languages such as Java and C. Later, we will touch on a few examples where we pass a callback continuation function to take full advantage of JavaScript&#8217;s non blocking design.</p>

<h2>Thread Safety</h2>

<p>Mozilla, in particular, provides a Worker interface which web workers implement. While the Worker interface spawns OS-level threads, web workers use the postMessage mechanism to send messages (with serializable objects) between the two execution contexts. To ensure thread safety the worker is only given access to thread safe components to include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>timers: setTimeout() and setInterval() methods</li>
<li>XMLHttpRequest</li>
<li>importScripts() method</li>
</ul>


<p>The worker script can also make use of:</p>

<ul>
<li>navigator and location objects</li>
<li>native JavaScript objects such as Object, String, Date</li>
</ul>


<p>At the same time, the worker restricts access to DOM APIs, global variables, and the parent page. In Hack #84 Building the DOM with web workers and Handlebars.js, we will explore the restricted access to DOM APIs, and introduce JavaScript templating, importScripts, and the use of timers to poll for postMessage.</p>

<h2>HTML5 Web Workers</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the Web worker spec defines an API for executing scripts in the background by spawning an independent execution context.</p>

<p>It is important to note that web workers are costly, having an impact on startup and overall memory consumption. So, they are intended to be used lightly and in conjunction with the some of the asynchronous techniques mentioned earlier. A well built client-side application would typically make use of one or two cases where tasks are expensive. Here are a few common uses cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single Page Application bootstrapping large amounts of data during initial load</li>
<li>Performing long running mathematical calculations in the browser</li>
<li>Processing large JSON datasets</li>
<li>Text formatting, spell checking, and syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Processing multimedia data (Audio/Video)</li>
<li>Long polling webservices</li>
<li>Filtering images in canvas</li>
<li>Calculating points for a 3D image</li>
<li>Reading/Writing of local storage database</li>
</ul>


<h2>Long Running Scripts</h2>

<p>Our first web worker hack will be a long running script with heavy computation. It will execute 2 loops that output a two-dimensional array. First, we will use this computation to lock up the browser&#8217;s UI thread, and later we will move the task to a worker.</p>

<h2>Spawning a Worker</h2>

<p>Now let&#8217;s move our heavy computational task to a dedicated web worker, so that the user doesn&#8217;t have to wait for the script to complete execution in order to interact with user interface. First, lets spawn a new worker:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>spawn.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">worker</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Worker</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;highComp.js&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">worker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">postMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">JSON</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">stringify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">worker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;message&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">){},</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here, we define an external file that will contain the logic of our heavy computational task. The file, highComp.js will listen for a message that will receive the serialized JSON payload, and then we will set up an additional listener to receive a message back from highComp.js.</p>

<p>Now, we can move this cpu-intensive task to a separate file: highComp.js</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>highComp.js </span></figcaption>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In highComp.js, our two dimensional array is built and set to variable a. It is then passed back to our main script via the postMessage call.</p>

<p>In the next hack, we will mix our use of timers with the power of a dedicated worker. As we send messages (passing serializable objects as a parameter to postMessage) back and forth to code running in the shared UI thread, our timer will periodically send and check for new messages and use their contents to modify the DOM.</p>
