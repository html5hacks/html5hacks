<p>Using our best CDD (Conference Driven Devlopment) techniques, we walked the audience through the creation of <a href="http://nerdclustr.jit.su">Nerdclustr</a>: an HTML5 mobile Application that helps nerds find other like-minded nerds at conferences events.</p>

<p>Using realtime and mapping technolgies, the app visualizes nerd behavior in map pin clusters.</p>

<p>Here is a shot of the app in action (Ballroom G in the Austin Convention Center); it performed well during the presentation. Thanks to <a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">Nodjitsu</a> for the quality node.js WebSocket service. After a 2-day hackathon to get the app launched, I ran through a number of deployment options, many of which I have used before for Rails applications. <a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">Nodjitsu</a> won out in that it actually supported the WebSokcet protocol and made deployment super simple using the jitsu CLI.</p>

<p>Nerdclustr source code is available <a href="https://github.com/html5hacks/nerd-clustr">here</a>.</p>

<p>During the book signing, the bookstore informed us there were only 3 copies left. I&rsquo;m not keen to the selection process of books, but I was little surprised at the limited number of technical books. This is certainly a reflection of the SXSWi demographic, and we also tailored our content and presentation style to this audience.</p>
