Thanks to [Nodjitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) for the quality node.js WebSocket service. After a 2-day hackathon to get the app launched, I ran through a number of deployment options, many of which I have used before for Rails applications. [Nodjitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) won out in that it actually supported the WebSokcet protocol and made deployment super simple using the jitsu CLI. \n\n<img class=\"imgL200\" alt=\"Jesse Cravens and Jeff Burtoft: SXSWi 2013 - HTML5 Hacks Book Signing\"  src=\"/images/sxsw13/sxsw13-booksigning.png\">\n\nNerdclustr source code is available [here](https://github.com/html5hacks/nerd-clustr). \n\nDuring the book signing, the bookstore informed us there were only 3 copies left. I'm not keen to the selection process of books, but I was little surprised at the limited number of technical books. This is certainly a reflection of the SXSWi demographic, and we also tailored our content and presentation style to this audience. \n\nThe slide deck is available here: \n\n<script async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"c69c92f06d880130bfaa22000a1f8363\" data-ratio=\"1.77777777777778\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"></script>\n\n<hr>\n\nStay tuned for our next presentation happening online, through O'Reilly Webcasts.
